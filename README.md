## Discussion
For this challenge, I focused my efforts on learning how to pass data between views, creating animations, and creating reusable components. I independently researched how to pass data between views in SwiftUI and decided to use @Binding variables. These variables are used to instantiate each Question view and utilizes data created from the Settings view. I look forward to learning more about managing multiple views and better utilizing states as I continue to struggle grasping this concept with declarative programming. For animations, I utilized ease-in-out fade effects when resetting Question views and switching between images tied to the wheel picker in the Settings view. As I gain more experience with declarative programming and SwiftUI, I believe understanding animation modifiers and transitions between views will become more clear.
