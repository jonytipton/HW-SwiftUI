## Discussion
While this project and accompanying challenges were quick to complete, I still gained useful experience with URLSession, Codable, async-await tasks, sharing data with multiple views, and testing HTTP requests (reqres.in). I am reasonably proficient with web development so my interest was piqued most by the asynchronous work done in this app. AsyncImage and Task will be vital in future apps that require the loading of dynamic content from the web or completing slow logic (i.e. network calls).
