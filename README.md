## Discussion
Gained experience with @Binding property wrapper which clarified my understanding of when/how to use it. I had previously used @Binding variables for challenges in prior projects but encountered an issue with a view not updating when using a @Binding variable - determined this was due to me using it in the wrong view (@Binding needs to be in the child view with @State in the parent).

Implemented Core Data with SwiftUI views and found the process much simpler than managing persistent data in Core Data.
