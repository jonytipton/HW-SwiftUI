## Discussion
- I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and learning how to present new views with SwiftUI. In a previous project (M2-Mathimals), I had presented new screens using if/else statements and am excited to use NavigationLinks instead after learning about them for this project. The past couple of days of work went smoothly as did the challenge - with which I gained useful experience refactoring SwiftUI view code from Content View into their own SwiftUI View files. This makes reading and creating modular views much simpler and easier to comprehend. As I continue to experiment with view modifiers and learn more features of SwiftUI I notice that I look at apps I use on a daily basis in a different way and try to understand how they are built if they appear to use SwiftUI.
