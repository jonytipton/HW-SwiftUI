## Discussion
This project went quickly as I already have experience with some of the discussed concepts (Codable, JSON, UserDefaults). I enjoyed learning how SwiftUI handles displaying/dismissing sheet views and found them simpler to create than a sheetPresentationController with UIKit. The identifiable and ObservableObject protocols are new to me but were easy to understand and implement in this project. I appreciate learning how to use the Identifiable protocol to clean-up ForEach loops by removing the need for explicitely stating an ID. I am looking forward to gaining more experience with the ObservableObject protocol - which seems easy to use but powerful for managing JSON and Class data.
